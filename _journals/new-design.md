Today, I'm just happy to create and release an update for my website with a simple and minimal design. What I need is something that reflects the way that I believe and the way I work, just to make things simple and functional as possible.

I have used Jekyll as a static site generator with GitHub and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to deploy the website. Also, I have used Sass and ITCSS to organize the CSS code. You can find the source code at [ahmadajmi.github.io](https://github.com/ahmadajmi/ahmadajmi.github.io).
