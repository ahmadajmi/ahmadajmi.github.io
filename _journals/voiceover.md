While studying the [Web Accessibility course from Google by Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/web-accessibility--ud891),  I came across this video explaining how to use the Mac VoiceOver as a screen reader to navigate the web and I thought it would be a great idea to share it. I also included the course description included with the video as a guide and a reference (video and the information credit goes to the course).

#### Shortcuts mentioned:

- `CMD`+`F5` to turn on VoiceOver on OS X.
- Normal keyboard operation (`TAB`, `Shift`+`TAB`, arrow keys etc.) work as normal with VoiceOver running.
- `CMD`+`L` to jump to address bar.
- `CTRL`+`Option`+`U` to open Web Rotor.
- Type search term with Web Rotor open to search within Web Rotor.
- `CTRL` + `Option` + `←` `↑` `↓` `→` to explore content.
- `CTRL` + `Option` + `CMD` + `H` to move forward by heading.
- `CTRL` + `Option` + `CMD` + `Shift` + `H` to move backward by heading.

[WebAIM’s article on Using VoiceOver to evaluate Web Accessibility] has a full introduction to VoiceOver from the point of view of evaluating accessibility, including most keyboard commands available.

If you don’t have a Mac device, [NVDA] is a free, open source screen reader available for Windows. [WebAIM’s introduction to NVDA] covers the basics of using NVDA to check accessibility.

If you only use Linux, [Orca] is available in the Gnome desktop manager, although this screen reader is much more rarely used and suffers from poor support by web browsers.
