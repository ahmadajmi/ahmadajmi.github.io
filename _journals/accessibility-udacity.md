Today, I just finished and I would recommend this Web Accessibility course from Google by Udacity.

Accessibility is something I wasn't taking seriously before and was just reading some bits here and there without understanding and seeing the big picture if using it.

The important thing is that there is a wide range of people who might have some disabilities and by ignoring them you will make their life harder and they will end up leaving, but the web should be available to everyone.

Think about how someone who is blind using the VoiceOver, and a simple case, someone who is only able to use the keyboard to navigate your website or app.

I encourage you to stop using the mouse for a while and just use your keyboard to navigate different websites or use the ChromeVox or VoiceOver as a screen reader.

The problem comes with no awareness about it, no budget, or not learning about it at the start of learning about web development as a single topic, somehow we ignore it and jump directly into writing HTML without thinking about this wide range of people who might use the end product.

The course helped to connect the dots and the important thing is to think about the end user while writing code or *Developing with Empathy* as the course said :)
