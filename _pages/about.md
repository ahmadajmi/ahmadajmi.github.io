Hello!

I'm Ahmad Ajmi, a Front End Developer from Cairo, Egypt.

<div hidden>
Learning to code was a life change for me, I graduated with a degree in Accounting, but I quit it entirely and moved on to learn how to code in HTML & CSS, and then I landed my first job as a web developer back in 2012.

Currently, I run an online business at [Aspire Themes](https://aspirethemes.com/) building premium WordPress, Ghost, and Jekyll themes.

In 2015, I founded [oktob.io](https://oktob.io/), a blogging platform for the Arabic world. I created it initially to solve a personal problem for not finding a simple and functional platform for writing in Arabic. The platform helped thousands of people write and read in Arabic with a simple and elegant UI. It's one of my favorite and challenging projects and I'm really proud of it.

Oktob was acquired by [Toriom](http://toriom.com/) in Feburary 2017.
