Recently I came accross this video while attending the Udacity coruse.

Shortcuts mentioned:

- `CMD`+`F5` to turn on VoiceOver on OS X
- Normal keyboard operation (`TAB`, `Shift`+`TAB`, arrow keys etc.)
    work as normal with VoiceOver running
- `CMD`+`L` to jump to address bar
- `CTRL`+`Option`+`U` to open Web Rotor
- Type search term with Web Rotor open to search within Web Rotor
- `CTRL` + `Option` + `←` `↑` `↓` `→` to explore content
- `CTRL` + `Option` + `CMD` + `H` to move forward by heading
- `CTRL` + `Option` + `CMD` + `Shift` + `H` to move backward by heading

[WebAIM’s article on Using VoiceOver to evaluate Web Accessibility] has a full introduction to VoiceOver from the point of view of evaluating accessibility, including most keyboard commands available.

If you don’t have a Mac device, [NVDA] is a free, open source screen reader available for Windows. [WebAIM’s introduction to NVDA] covers the basics of using NVDA to check accessibility.

If you only use Linux, [Orca] is available in the Gnome desktop manager, although this screen reader is much more rarely used and suffers from poor support by web browsers.
